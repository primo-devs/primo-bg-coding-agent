# Authentication and Authorization

Open-Inspect uses authentication to establish who you are and workspace authorization to decide what
you can do. This guide explains the behavior users and workspace administrators will see.

> **Important:** Open-Inspect is designed for a single trusted organization. A deployment is one
> workspace, and the source-control App installation defines the repositories available to that
> workspace. Roles control which Open-Inspect features a person can use; teams and session
> visibility further limit access to sessions. Neither is a replacement for source-control
> repository permissions.

## Signing In

A deployment can offer GitHub sign-in, Google sign-in, or both. The sign-in page shows only the
providers configured by the deployment operator.

Signing in has two stages:

1. Your identity provider verifies your identity and email address.
2. The deployment's admission rules determine whether you may join the workspace.

Depending on the deployment configuration, admission can be limited by:

- GitHub username
- Verified email address
- Verified email domain
- Active membership in an allowed GitHub organization

These rules are checked when you sign in. Removing someone from an allowlist or GitHub organization
does not end an existing browser session; an Administrator or Owner can suspend the member when
access must be revoked immediately.

Authentication does not make someone an Owner or Administrator. Every admitted user has exactly one
workspace role, and new users receive the Member role by default.

## Workspace Roles

Open-Inspect includes four built-in roles.

| Capability                                        | Owner | Administrator | Member | Viewer |

| View provider accounts                            |  Yes  |      Yes      |  Yes   |   No   |
| View image-build history                          |  Yes  |      Yes      |  Yes   |  Yes   |
| Manage personal skill profiles                    |  Yes  |      Yes      |  Yes   |   No   |

### Owner

Owners administer the workspace but do not automatically collaborate in other people's private
sessions. Only Owners can grant or remove the Owner role or suspend and restore another Owner.
Open-Inspect also prevents the final active Owner from being suspended or demoted, so the workspace
cannot accidentally lose all ownership.

### Administrator

Administrators can operate the workspace day to day. They can manage members, permitted sessions,
automations, repositories, environments, provider accounts, integrations, and secrets. They cannot
access another person's private session unless added as a collaborator. They cannot transfer
ownership, change who holds the Owner role, or suspend and restore an Owner.

### Member

Members can create and use sessions, collaborate in sessions visible to them (with current
owning-team membership for team-owned sessions, and private-session participation), use shared
repositories and environments, and create automations. They can manage and manually trigger
automations they own but cannot modify another person's automation or administer shared
configuration. They can view workspace analytics.

### Viewer

Viewers have read-only access to shared workspace resources. They can inspect sessions visible to
them, automations, analytics, repositories, environments, skills, and MCP servers. They cannot
create or prompt sessions, access sandboxes, manage personal skill profiles, trigger automations, or
change shared configuration.

## Teams and Session Visibility

Teams are optional within a workspace. Existing and teamless sessions remain workspace rows with
`ownerTeamId: null`; creating a team does not move them into it. A team has members and leads, a
join policy (open or invite-only), and a default session visibility. Owners and Administrators can
create teams in **Settings > Teams**; the creator becomes the first lead. Team membership does not
replace the workspace role: a person still needs the relevant session permission in addition to any
team access.

### Team Directory and Pages

Every active workspace user can list active teams and read their member lists, even without
membership in those teams. The team directory supports search and favorites, and team pages show
team metadata and members. Archived teams and their member lists are available only to their members
and workspace Owners and Administrators.

The team directory and the session collaborator picker identify people by display name and avatar.
Email addresses are included only for viewers with `workspace.members.read` (Owners and
Administrators in the built-in roles); all other viewers receive `email: null`, including team leads
and session owners. An unnamed user is labeled with a short user ID suffix instead of an email
address or full ID. This privacy rule applies in every team enforcement mode.

A team's session overview is available to its members and workspace Owners and Administrators, with
session visibility checks applied on the server. Team pages do not expose an audit activity feed.
Team operations are still recorded in the workspace audit log behind `workspace.audit.read`; its
team filter includes teams the reader does not belong to.

The sidebar context defaults to **All my teams**, which leaves session lists unfiltered by team
while preserving server visibility checks. Users with at least one active team can choose Workspace
(teamless rows), a team, or All my teams; Owners and Administrators can also choose All teams. Users
without active teams have no selector and keep unfiltered lists. A stored Workspace or active-team
choice is retained; unknown or archived selections fall back to All my teams.

The new-session composer's team and visibility are draft-local choices initialized from the sidebar
context. Changing them does not change the sidebar or command-menu recents. If a team is required
and the context does not name one, the composer selects the user's first active team locally.

### Session Visibility

Each session stores a visibility independently of its team:

| Visibility  | Who can read the session when team enforcement is on                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `workspace` | Workspace users with session read permission, even if the session has a team.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `team`      | Members of the owning team, plus workspace Owners and Administrators, with session read permission. Requires an owning team.                                                                                                                                     |
| `private`   | The session owner and explicit collaborators (who must be current owning-team members on team-owned sessions) with session read permission. A workspace Owner can also open it by ID under audited break-glass access; Administrators do not get this exception. |

Private visibility is enforced in every enforcement mode. An Owner's break-glass read is audited,
does not cause the session to appear in their lists, and does not grant prompt or sandbox access. An
Owner with the required lifecycle or delete permission can manage a private session they opened by
ID, but must also be a current member of the owning team if the session is team-owned; being an
Administrator alone does not grant access. Actorless bot services cannot read private sessions;
user-backed integration requests still depend on the acting user's access.

For a team-owned session, **every non-read action requires current membership in the owning team**
in `off`, `shadow`, and `on` modes. Session owners, team leads, workspace Owners, and Administrators
are not exempt. This includes prompting, sandbox access, lifecycle operations, deletion, visibility
changes, and collaborator management, in addition to the relevant workspace permissions and
action-specific rules. Visibility still controls read access: a readable workspace-visible session
or an explicit private-session collaborator grant does not grant team membership or authorize
non-read actions. The sole exception is a collaborator removing themselves, which requires only
session read access.

Owners and Administrators must join the owning team before acting on its sessions; team membership
changes are audited.

The **Mine** filter helps find sessions you created but does not define who may access them. A
session's owner is its creating workspace user, not its team. Explicit collaborators are an access
grant for private sessions; they still need the relevant workspace permission to read, prompt, or
use the sandbox. Runtime participants record who connected or contributed and may carry runtime
credentials; being a participant alone is not a visibility grant. Conversely, making someone a
collaborator does not turn them into a runtime participant. Removing a collaborator revokes their
private-session access on subsequent authorization checks. Adding collaborators or removing someone
else requires `manageCollaborators`: after the session read check, only the session owner or a
workspace Owner may do so, with current owning-team membership for team-owned sessions. A
collaborator may remove themselves with session read access alone; team membership, collaboration,
or lifecycle permission is not required for self-removal.

The collaborator picker is available to session owners and workspace Owners after the session read
and collaborator-management checks. For a workspace-owned session it lists every active workspace
user; for a team-owned session it lists only active members of the owning team, and adding anyone
else is rejected with `not_team_member`. Selecting a collaborator is an explicit private-session
access grant, not a team membership or workspace role change. On a team-owned session the grant is
honored only while the collaborator remains a current member of the owning team: leaving or being
removed from the team ends their collaborator access on the next authorization check, even though
the collaborator record itself is kept.

Session actions have additional rules after visibility: prompting requires collaboration permission,
sandbox use requires sandbox permission, and lifecycle operations require lifecycle permission. With
team enforcement on, or for team-owned sessions in any mode, deletion requires delete permission
**and** session ownership, a lead role in the owning team, or a workspace Owner/Administrator role.
Team leads do not gain access to private sessions simply by leading the team. Changing private
visibility is reserved for the session owner or a workspace Owner. These role and ownership rules
never bypass the current-membership requirement for team-owned actions. Private-session action rules
apply even while team enforcement is off or in shadow mode.

### Creating Sessions

Session creation checks the selected repository or environment as well as the creator's workspace
permission. Supplying a team requires active membership in that team and a grant covering **every**
repository used by the session; archived teams cannot be selected. Without an explicit visibility,
team sessions use the team's default and teamless sessions default to `workspace`. `team` visibility
requires a team; `private` requires a workspace user owner. A teamless session may still be private.

Owners and Administrators can configure **Settings > Teams > Require a team for new sessions**
(`requireTeamOnCreate`). It is off by default. When enabled, new sessions must select a team; it
refuses session creation API requests without a team with `team_required`. The web app supports team
selection; team selection in bots is a later phase, so their teamless creation API requests are also
refused when the setting is enabled. Automation runs are exempt until automation team ownership is
supported. The setting does not migrate or hide existing `ownerTeamId: null` workspace rows.

Team leads and workspace Owners/Administrators manage repository grants in the team's Repositories
tab or through `/teams/:id/repository-grants`. Team members and workspace Owners/Administrators can
read the grants. A team can have either installation-wide access or named grants by SCM repository
ID, but not both. Creating a team does not grant repository access. Repository-backed team sessions
without covering grants are refused with `target_team_missing_grant`. Repository-less team sessions
do not need grants. Removing a grant advances the team's grant version and leaves existing
repository references intact; grants do not yet narrow or revoke sandbox installation tokens.

Repository skills, repository secrets, and repository image builds remain workspace-level resources;
grants do not assign them to an owning team. They keep their existing permission checks when no team
grants the repository. Once any team grants it, callers must be current members of an active
granting team (leads for repository secrets), or be a workspace Owner or Administrator. Installation
grants count for every repository. Importing repository secrets into an environment checks the
source repository's workspace-level grant access as well as the destination owning team's coverage,
if the environment has an owning team. These checks apply in every `TEAMS_ENFORCEMENT` mode.

Manual environment image builds instead follow the environment's owning team. For a team-owned
environment, the caller must be a current member of that team or a workspace Owner/Administrator,
and the active owning team must have grants covering every current repository in the environment.
Membership or grants in another team cannot replace that coverage, including for Owners and
Administrators. Workspace-level environment builds keep their existing checks. These rules apply in
every `TEAMS_ENFORCEMENT` mode.

Sessions, automations, and environments cannot move between teams or between a team and the
workspace. A session's owning team is fixed at creation: a team-owned session never becomes
workspace-owned. Changing its visibility to `workspace` changes who may read it, not its ownership
or the team membership required for non-read actions.

Visibility changes can include descendants. A cascading visibility change refuses the entire request
if any included descendant is inaccessible or denies the requested action, including the
current-membership check for each team-owned descendant; it does not silently skip that descendant.
The web visibility control requires a changed selection and asks for confirmation when applying
non-private visibility to child sessions, since private descendants will receive that visibility
too. Team grants constrain repository selection, not the source-control App token already available
to a running sandbox.

Session discovery and inbox filters compose on the server: `ownerFilter=started` matches the
creator, `participating` also includes explicit collaborators and users with persisted read state,
and `anyone` adds no ownership filter. `visibility=team|workspace|private` and repeated `teamIds[]`
narrow the readable rows. `scope=workspace` means teamless sessions, not workspace visibility;
`scope=all` is reserved for workspace Owners and Administrators and does not bypass visibility or
enumerate break-glass-only private sessions. Inbox `mine=true` remains creator-only and excludes
direct automation and GitHub-bot sessions, but retains eligible agent descendants.

### Enforcement and Access Paths

Operators set `TEAMS_ENFORCEMENT` to `off`, `shadow` (the default), or `on`:

- `off`: legacy read visibility for non-private sessions and legacy actions for non-private
  workspace-owned sessions. Private access and the full action resolver for team-owned sessions
  remain enforced.
- `shadow`: continue those legacy reads and workspace-owned actions while auditing would-be denials.
  Private access and the full action resolver for team-owned sessions remain enforced.
- `on`: enforce visibility, team membership, and action/ownership rules for sessions.

No mode relaxes current owning-team membership for non-read actions, including for workspace Owners
and Administrators. The visibility and collaborator mutation routes always enforce the session
access resolver, including in `off` and `shadow` modes. Those modes do not relax these mutation
checks or the checks on descendants included in a cascading operation. Collaborator self-removal
remains read-only-authorized in every mode.

The session boundary covers four paths, not just the session page:

- **HTTP item routes** authorize by the persisted session row before serving snapshots, actions,
  children, exports, or other session-specific data. A session hidden by visibility responds with a
  non-enumerating `404` rather than confirming that its ID exists.
- **Lists and aggregates** filter by visibility before returning sessions in search, inbox, child
  lists, bulk export, and analytics. Private sessions do not appear in an Owner's lists solely
  because of break-glass access; administrative analytics can include a scope-filtered, unattributed
  private cost total without exposing those sessions.
- **Durable Object connections** recheck subscription and commands against the current session row,
  so a stale browser tab does not turn a previous grant into lasting access. A private break-glass
  subscription requires an audit write.
- **Sandbox access** is a separate session action. Snapshot sandbox URLs and supported sandbox tools
  are not granted just because a session can be read; a break-glass Owner cannot use another
  person's private sandbox without becoming a collaborator. Session-bound sandbox credentials are
  not general user visibility grants.

New HTTP requests reflect role, membership, collaborator, and visibility changes on the next check.
Live browser connections are rechecked at least every five minutes, so an existing connection may
remain open for up to five minutes after access changes. Recreating the session is not required.

## How Automation Access Works

Automation definitions and run history are visible workspace-wide to roles with automation read
access. Creating, changing, and manually triggering automations use ownership rules.

- Members can manage and manually trigger automations they own.
- Administrators and Owners can manage and manually trigger any automation.
- Viewers can inspect automations but cannot create, change, or run them.

Automation ownership follows the signed-in account that created it, not a display name or external
provider username.

### Scheduled and Event Runs

Scheduled and event-driven runs execute under the automation owner's authority. At run time, the
owner must still be active and allowed to create sessions and use every selected repository or
environment. If those permissions have been removed, the run does not start.

### Manual Runs

A manual run executes under the authority of the person who clicked **Run**, even when an
Administrator or Owner triggers someone else's automation. The requester must be allowed both to
trigger that automation and to create the resulting session with its selected resources. Their
identity and linked source-control credentials are used for that run.

See [Automations](AUTOMATIONS.md) for trigger setup and run behavior.

## Bots and Integrations

Slack, GitHub, and Linear integrations act on behalf of a workspace user when they handle a user
request. Their effective access is limited by both:

- The acting user's current role
- The integration's fixed set of allowed operations

This means an integration cannot bypass a suspended user or perform workspace administration simply
because the acting user is an Owner. Calls that do not identify an acting user are denied unless a
specific integration route explicitly permits that operation.

Some integrations also apply their own ingress rules. For example, the GitHub integration may
require an allowed trigger user or sufficient repository collaborator access before it sends a
request to Open-Inspect.

## Suspension

Suspending a member disables their workspace access without deleting their account or historical
attribution.

After suspension:

- New browser and bot operations are denied.
- Existing browser sign-in sessions are invalidated.
- Live browser session connections close within five minutes.
- Scheduled and event-driven automations owned by the member no longer pass run authorization.
- Existing session history and authorship remain intact.

Suspension does not automatically stop a sandbox that is already executing. An Administrator or
Owner can manage that session separately.

## Repository and Credential Boundaries

Open-Inspect uses a shared source-control App installation for clone, fetch, and push operations.
The App should be installed only on repositories intended for the workspace. Team repository grants
check which repositories may be chosen for a team session; they do **not** narrow the shared
installation token delivered to a sandbox. Token narrowing is a future phase, not a protection
provided by team visibility today.

A user's role determines whether they may read or use workspace repositories, but Open-Inspect does
not compare that role with the user's personal GitHub access for each repository. Linked GitHub
credentials can be used for actions such as attributed pull-request creation; when no suitable user
credential is available, supported operations may use the shared App identity.

Secrets and provider credentials are not made visible through role-based read access. Administrative
permissions control who can configure them, and saved secret values are not returned to the browser.
See [Secrets Management](SECRETS.md) for details.

## Workspace Administration

Owners and Administrators can manage members from **Settings > Workspace access**. Depending on
their own role, they can:

- Review workspace members and assigned roles
- Change a member's role
- Suspend or restore a member

Only an Owner can assign or remove the Owner role or suspend and restore another Owner. The final
active Owner cannot be suspended or demoted.

### Initial Owner Setup

The first person who signs in receives the default Member role and is not promoted to Owner
automatically. On a new deployment, the intended Owner must sign in once, after which a deployment
operator runs the Owner bootstrap command using that person's Open-Inspect user ID. See
[Getting Started](GETTING_STARTED.md#step-9-bootstrap-the-workspace-owner) for the deployment steps.
